HEADNOTE:
<a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_7">Section 32</a>  (1)	 (ii)  of  the	<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">Income	Tax  Act</a>,  1961
provided for  depreciation, while  computing business income
for purpose of income tax. It was allowed at a percentage of
the written down value of certain capital assets employed in
the business.  <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_9">Section 35(1)</a>  provided for  the deduction of
four types  of expenditure  on scientific  research and	 the
deduction provided under 35 (1 ) (iv) was to the effect that
in respect  of	any  expenditure  of  a	 capital  nature  on
scientific research  related to	 the business  carried on by
the assessee,  such deduction as may be admissible under the
provisions of  sub-section  (2).  Sub-Section  (2)  provided
that, for  the purposes	 of clause  (iv) of sub-section (1),
one-fifth  of	the  capital  expenditure  incurred  in	 any
previous year should be deducted for that previous year; and
the balance  of the  expenditure should be deducted in equal
instalments in	each  of  the  four  immediately  succeeding
previous years.	 It further provided in clauses (iv) and (v)
that where  a deduction	 was allowed  for any  previous year
under this  section in	respect of  expenditure	 represented
wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction should be allowed
under clauses  (i), (ii)  and (iii)  of sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_10">section 32</a>  for the  same previous  year in  respect of that
asset; and where the asset mentioned in clause (ii) was used
in the business after it ceased to be used for scientific
research related  to that  business, depreciation  should be
admissible under  clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section
(1) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_11">Section 32</a>.
Explanation 1 to <a href="/doc/345447/" id="a_12">Section 43(1)</a> also provided that where
an asset was used in business after it ceased to be used for
scientific research related to that business and a deduction
had to be made under clause (i), clause (ii) or clause (iii)
or sub-section	(1) or	sub-section (1A)  of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_13">Section  32</a>  in
respect of  that asset,	 the actual cost of the asset to the
assessee, as  reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed
under clause (iv) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_14">Section 35</a>.
The provisions	of <a href="/doc/1004921/" id="a_15">Section 32(1)</a> (ii) and <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_16">Section 35(2)</a>
(1) (iv)  and (v)  read with  Explanation 1 to <a href="/doc/345447/" id="a_17">Section 43(1)</a>
virtually repeated the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_18">Section 10(2)</a>
(vi) and 10(2) (xiv) of the 1922 Act.
In 1968,  there was  an amendment  in the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_19">Section 35(2)</a>.	The effect  of the  amendment was  that	 the
entire amount of capital expenditure incurred in relation to
scientific research  was allowed as a deduction in one year,
instead of being spread over a period of five years as was
the position earlier.
Thereafter, the	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_20">Finance Act</a>,  1980 made  an  amendment
with retrospective  effect from 1.4.1962, i.e. from the date
of commencement	 of Act	 of 1961 which provided under clause
(iv) of	 <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_21">Section 35(2)</a>,	 that where  a deduction was allowed
for any	 previous year	under this  section  in	 respect  of
expenditure represented	 wholly or  partly by  an asset,  no
deduction should  be allowed  under clauses  (i),  (ii)	 and
(iii) of  sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_22">Section 32</a>, for the same or any
other previous year in respect of that asset.
In the Writ Petitions filed before this Court on behalf
of the	asses	sees it was contended that the allowances in
respect of  depreciation on  the one  hand  and	 of  capital
expenditure on	scientific research  on the  other  are	 two
totally different  and independent  heads of allowances; one
was a notional allowance to provide for the wear and tear of
a capital asset employed in the business as the years rolled
by; and	 the other  was an  allowance for actual expenditure
of a capital nature granted to give fillip to new industrial
innovations  and  development  of  indigenous  know-how	 and
techniques by proper planning on research and development by
various business  houses; and  therefore there	was  nothing
wrong in  construing the  statute as  providing cumulatively
for both  types of deductions in respect of the same capital
asset; that  both the  types of allowances were	 permissible
under the  statute except  to the  extent limited by clauses
(iv) and (v) of <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_23">Section 35</a> of the Act/Clauses (d) and (e) of
the proviso  to <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_24">Section	 10(2)</a> (xiv)  of the  1922 Act; that
this interpretation  of the  statutory provisions  was	very
clear.	patent	 and  unambiguous;  that  the  retrospective
amendment of  the  provision  would  impose  unexpected	 and
impossible   burden on them over the years, jeopardise their
solvency and  lay them	open  to  action  by  creditors	 and
financial  institutions	 and  such  an	onerous	 burden	 was
unreasonable and  oppressive and the provision imposing such
a burden  violated the	fundamental rights  of the assessees
under Articles	14 and	19(1) (g)  of the  Constitution that
retrospective provisions  may be  permissible even in taxing
statutes in  certain special  circumstances such   as in the
case of	 provisions  clarifying	 the  impact  of  a  statute
provision curing  defective legislations in the light of the
judicial decisions and the like but if the legislature chose
to impose  a totally  new burden  which was  not at  all  in
contemplation	earlier	  and	proceeded   to	 give	full
retrospective effect  thereto  such  an	 attempt  should  be
struck down  as unreasonable   and  discriminatory. that the
amendment was not in the nature of a statutory clarification
of an  ambiguity but  a totally	 new  and  fresh  imposition
sought to  be unjustifiably  given retrospective  effect and
that the  statute did  not intend  one deduction to preclude
other.
On behalf  of the  Revenue it  was contended  that  the
deduction   provided by	 <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_25">Section 35</a>  (1)  (iv)	was  in	 the
alternative to	the deduction  provided by  clauses (i) (ii)
and (iii) of sub-section (1) and sub-section (1A) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_26">Section
32</a>; if	one was	 availed of  the other was not available not
only during  the year  or years in which the deduction under
<a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_27">Section 35(1)</a>  (iv) was	 availed of but permanently; for the
reason that  if both  were   allowed to	 be availed  of;  it
amounted to grant of 200% deduction viz., 100% under <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_28">Section
35(1)</a> (iv)  and another 100% under sub-sections (1) and (1A)
of  <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_29">Section   32</a>,  and	 this  was   totally   outside	 the
contemplation of the Act.
Dismissing the writ petitions, this Court,
HELD: Per  Ranganathan J.  (For himself	 and Ramaswami,
J.)
1.1. There  is a  fundamental, though  unwritten, axiom
that no	 legislature could  have at  all intended  a  double
deduction in  regard to the same business outgoing; if it is
intended it  will be  clearly expressed. In other  words, in
the absence  of clear statutory	 indication to the contrary,
the statute  should not	 be read so as to permit an assessee
two deductions	both under  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_30">Section 10(2)</a>  (vi) and  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_31">section
10(2)</a> (xiv)  under the 1922 Act or under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_32">Section 32</a> (i) (ii)
and 35(2)  (iv) of  the 1961 Act - qua the same expenditure.
The use	 of the words "in respect of the same previous year"
in clause  (d) of  the proviso to <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_33">Section 10(2)</a> (xiv) of the
1922 Act  and <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_34">Section  35</a> (2)  (iv) of the 1961 Act is not a
contra-indication   which    permits   a   disallowance	  of
depreciation only  in the  previous years in which the other
allowance is  actually allowed.	 The purpose  of  the  words
above  referred	 to  is	 totally  different.  That  the	 two
allowances cannot  be and  are not intended to be granted in
respect of  the same  asset or	expenditure, can   be easily
seen from  the limitation  imposed by these words. Where the
capital asset  is one  of the nature specified, the assessee
can get	 only one  of the two allowances in question but not
both. For  determining which of the two allowances should be
granted -  that which the assessee chooses or that which the
assessing officer  might prefer,  it is	 necessary  for	 the
statute	  to define  this and  this is what has been done by
the rider  in clause  (d) of  the proviso  to <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_35">Section  10(2)</a>
(xiv) of the 1922 Act <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_36">Section 35(2)</a> (iv) of the 1961 Act. It
mandates that  the asssessee  should, in  such	a  case,  be
granted the  special allowance	for scientific	research and
not the	 routine and annual one for depreciation. Clause (d)
of the	proviso to  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_37">Section 10(2)</a>  (xiv) of the 1922 Act and
<a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_38">Section 30(2)(iv)</a> of the 1961 Act thus fall into place as an
appropriate and necessary provision. The provision contained
in clause  (e) of  the proviso to <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_39">Section 10(2)</a> (xiv) of the
1922 Act,  re-enacted in Explanation to <a href="/doc/345447/" id="a_40">Section 43(1)</a> of the
1961 Act,  also reinforces this line of approach. Therefore,
it is  not correct  to say that the allowances under the two
provisions are	by nature  unconnected with,  and indpendent
of, each other. [171-D-H; 172-A-E]
1.2. Under  the provisions of the statute as they stood
earlier, the   assessees  could not  have claimed  continued
grant of  depreciation after  the expiry  of  five  previous
years before  the 1968 amendment and after the expiry of the
first year  after the 1968 amendment, even though the entire
cost of the capital asset in question had been allowed to be
written off completely against the business profits of those
five previous years or one previous year as the case may be.
It is  impossible to  conceive	of  the	 legislature  having
envisaged   a  double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same
expenditure even  though it  is true  that the	two heads of
deduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some
difference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under
consideration. The  last few  words of	the English statute,
viz., "assets  for any year of assessment during any part of
which they were used by the person carrying on the trade for
scientific research related to the trade" show that there is
really no  difference between  the English  and <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_41">Indian Act</a>s;
the former also in terms prohibits depreciation only so long
as the	assets are  used for  scientific research. [169-F-H;
171-B, C]
1.3. In	 the circumstances,  it	 is  clear  that,  even
before the  1980-  amendment,  the  Act	 did  not  permit  a
deduction for  depreciation in	respect of  the	 cost  of  a
capital asset  acquired for  purposes of scientific research
to the	extent such  cost has been written off under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_42">Section
10(2)</a> (xiv)  of the  1922 Act/35(1)  &amp; (2)  of the 1961 Act.
Prior to  1968, such  assets qualified	for an	allowance of
one-fifth of  the cost	of the	asset in five previous years
starting with that of its acquisition and during these years
the assessee  could not	 get any  depreciation	in  relation
thereto. In  respect of	 assets acquired  in  previous	year
relevant to  assessment year  1968-69 and  thereafter, their
cost was written off in the previous year of acquisition and
no depreciation would be allowed in that year. This is clear
from  the  statute.  Equally,  it  is  not  envisaged,	that
depreciation could  be allowed	on them	 thereafter and also
that it	 could be allowed starting with the original cost of
the asset  despite its	user for scientific research and the
allowances made	 under	the  'scientific  research'  clause.
There was  no difficult	 at all in the interpretation of the
provisions. The	 mere fact  that a baseless claim was raised
by some	 over-enthusiastic assessees  who  sought  a  double
allowance or  that such claim may perhaps have been accepted
by some	 authorities is	 not  sufficient  to  attribute	 any
ambiguity or doubt as to the true scope of the provisions as
they stood earlier. [173-E-H; 174-<a href="/doc/1636268/" id="a_43">A]

1.4. The  assessees may have some possible case only if
the earlier  statutory provisions  can be  said to have been
unambiguously  in  favour  of  the  assessee  and  the	1980
amendment had radically altered the provisions to cast a new
and substantial burden on the assessee with retrospective
effect but  there is  no ambiguity.  The 1980  amendment has
effected no  change at	all in	the provisions except to set
out more  clearly and  categorically what the provision said
even  earlier.	 Thus,	even   without	the  amendment,	 the
assessees  cannot   claim  the	 depreciation  allowance  in
question. Even if it is	 assumed that there was an ambiguity
or doubt  as to	 interpretation,  that	was  retrospectively
clarified by the legislature. Therefore, the validity of the
amendment cannot  be challenged.  This is  indeed beyond all
doubt. [174-C-G]

1.1.  A	  double  deduction   cannot  be  a  matter  of
inference; it  must be	 provided  for in  clear and express
language,  regard  having  to  its  serious  impact  on	 the
revenues of  the State. If the Legislature/Parliament wanted
to provide for more than 100% deduction they would have said
so, as	they done in cases where they have provided for what
is called  "weighted deduction",  vide <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_50">Section	35(B)</a> of the
Act of	1961.  It  is  not  possible  to  agree	 that  while
introducing clause (xiv) in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_51">Section 10</a> of
the 1922 Act consequent on the introduction of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_52">Section 20(4)</a>
in the	U.K. finance  Act, 1944,  the Indian  Legislature as
also the  Parliament made  a conscious	departure  from	 the
English Amendment  with the  idea of providing an additional
incentive  over	 and  above  the  deduction  on	 account  of
depreciation, to  induce the Indian assessees to invest more
in scientific research.
1.2. The  underlying reason  in clause	(iv) of <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_53">Section
35(2)</a> of  Act of   1961	 providing that	 during the years or
year in	 which the  assessee avails  of the  deduction under
<a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_54">Section 35(1)</a>  (iv) he	should not avail of the deduction on
account of  depreciation provided  by clauses  (i), (ii) and
(iii) of sub- section (1) and sub-section (1A) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_55">Section 32</a>
is to ensure that the assessee does not get double deduction
for example, where the asset was  acquired prior to April 1,
1957, the  deduction  under  <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_56">Section  35(1)</a>  (iv)  would  be
allowed in  five consecutive  years. If during the very five
previous  years,   depreciation	 under	 the  aforementioned
provisions is  also allowed,  the assessee  would obtain, at
the end	 of five  years, a  double depreciation	 i.e.,	100%
under <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_57">Section  35</a> and almost 100% under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_58">Section 32</a>. (In many
cases, the  rate of  depreciation under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_59">Section 32</a> is 20% or
even higher).  If such	a course  was barred  by clause (iv)
during the initial five years, it would not be reasonable to
say  that  same	 thing	can  be	 achieved  by  claiming	 the
deduction after	 the expiry  of	 five  years.  If  both	 the
deductions are	in the	alternative, as	 indicated by clause
(iv), they  must be  understood as  being in the alternative
and not	 consecutive. It  would be a rather curious thing to
say (in	 the case  of an  asset acquired  prior to  April 1,
1967) that  Parliament barred  claim for  depreciation under
<a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_60">Section 32</a>  even in the first year when only 20% of the cost
of the	asset is  allowed as  deduction under  <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_61">Section 35(1)</a>
(iv), it  barred it  in the  second, third and fourth years,
when the deduction had reached 40, 60 and 80 per cent but
permitted it  be claimed after the fifth year, by which year
the entire 100%	 cost was allowed as a deduction. No express
provision was  necessary to  say what  is  so  obvious.	 The
position after	April 1.  1967 is  no  different.  That	 the
aforesaid  view	  is  the   correct  one   is  indicated  by
Explanation  (1)   to  clause	(1)  of	  <a href="/doc/394567/" id="a_62">Section  43</a>	[the
corresponding provision in the 1922 Act being sub-clause (e)
of clause (xiv) of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_63">Section 10(2)</a> of 1922 Act].

13. The	 amendment of  <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_64">Section 35(2)</a>  in 1980 is merely
clarificatory in nature. It makes explicit what was implicit
in  the	  provisions.  question	 of  its  constitutionality,
therefore,  does   not	arise.	 Though	 purporting   to  be
retrospective, it  does not  take away	any rights which had
legally vested in the assessees. [180-<a href="/doc/934411/" id="a_65">B]

1.4. None  of the  assessments relating	 to any	 of the
assessment years  in question  has become  final.  They	 are
pending at  one or  the other  stage and in one or the other
forum. Since  the amendment  under  challenge  merely  makes
explicit which	was implicit  in the unamended clause, there
is no  question of any right vesting in the assessee and its
being taken away. [180-H; 181-A]

</p><p id="p_3">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     RANGANATHAN, J.  The seeds	 of the	 present controversy
were sown  as early  as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this
matter should  be  coming  up  before  this  Court  for	 its
consideration nearly  five decades  later, though it must be
pointed out  that the  issue in	 its  present  form  is	 the
outcome of an amendment made by the <a href="/doc/227413/" id="a_67">Finance (No.2) Act</a>, 1980
(hereinafter referred  to as  'the 1980	 Act') to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_68">Income
Tax Act</a>,  1961* (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1961 Act').
It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected
two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and
the validity  of both  these provisions have been challenged
before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard
to the	retrospective amendment	 of s.80-J which was settled
by this	 Court by its decision in <a href="/doc/1945591/" id="a_69">Lohia Machines Limited  v.
Union of India</a>, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second
amendment to  the provisions  contained in  <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_70">section 35(2)</a> of
the 1961  Act that has given rise to the present controversy
between the parties.
</p><p id="p_4">     The question  is really  one of  interpretation of	 two
important provisions relating to the computation of business
income for  purposes of	 income tax.  We may  start with the
provisions of  the Indian  lncome <a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_71">Tax Act</a>, 1922 (hereinafter
referred to  as the '1922 Act'). The computation of business
income for  purposes of	 income tax  was done  in accordance
with the  provisions of	 <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_72">section 10</a>  of the said Act. In the
process of making such computation, the Act provided for two
important deductions  (among  others),	in  respect  of	 the
capital assets	employed in  the business. The first was the
deduction under clause (vi) of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_73">Section 10(2)</a> of an allowance
in respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant
or furniture being the property of the assessee and used for
the purposes  of the business, at a prescribed percentage of
the written  down value	 of such  assets. This	allowance is
calculated, in	respect of  the year  of acquisition  of the
property, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee
and in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of
the actual  cost less the depreciation allowances granted in
the preceding years. In strict principle, this is an
allowance of  capital nature but it is now well settled that
the allowance  of depreciation	has to be taken into account
in order  to ascertain	the true  profits of a business and,
therefore, an  assessee	 is  permitted	to  deduct,  in	 the
computation of	the business  income year  after  year,	 the
prescribed percentage  of the  value of	 the assets used for
the purposes of business. The second allowance was not there
in the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income-
tax <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_74">(Amendment)	 Act</a>, 1946.  The introduction was of certain
allowances  in	 respect  of   expenditure  on.	 "scientific
research related  to the  business", an expression which was
defined in  a fairly  comprehensive manner  by the  statute.
Three types  of allowances were permitted in respect of this
category of  expenditure of which we are here concerned with
only one.  This provision  was contained  in clause (xiv) of
S.10(2) which permitted a deduction.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "in respect of any expenditure of a

<p id="p_5">     A cursory	and conjoint  reading of  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_75">section 10(2)</a> (vi)
and <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_76">section  10(2)</a> (xiv)  suggests that	 where	an  assessee

research related to the business and the expenditure results
in the	acquisition of	an asset,  the assessee	 can  claim,
under clause  (vi), a  deduction of the specified percentage
of the	written down  value of	the asset   and under clause
</p><p id="p_6">(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years,
of the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the
asset. For  this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used
for scientific research related to the business is also ipso
facto an  asset used  for the purpose of business. There has
been some  debate before  us as to whether this is always so
but we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes
of the present case.
</p><p id="p_7">     It will  at once  be seen that, if these two provisions
are applied   simultaneously, it would result in granting an
assessee  a   double  allowance	  in  respect  of  the	same
expenditure -  one of  the entire amount over a period	of 5
years and  the other  a percentage of the expenditure over a
number .  consecutive years  at a  graded scale	 as  already
mentioned. The	question at  once leaps	 to the	 mind as  to
whether it  could have been the intention of the legislature
to  permit   both  these  deductions  simultaneously  to  an
assessee. The  provisions of  clauses (d)  and	(e)  of	 the
proviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  contain a  clue  to	answer	this
question. More about it later.

<a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_80">Section 35(1)</a>  provides for  the deduction  of four types of

of allowances.	 one  is a notional allowance to provide for
the wear  and tear  of	a  capital  asset  employed  in	 the
business as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for
actual expenditure  of a  capital nature granted, on the eve
of our	country's independence,	 in order  to give fillip to
new industrial innovations and the development of indigenous
know-how and  techniques by  proper planning on research and
development by	various business  houses. It  is   therefore
suggested that	there is  nothing absurd  in construing	 the
statutes act  as providing  cumulatively for  both types  of
deductions in  respect of  the same  capital asset. The only
limitations on	this right are the two placed by the statute
itself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the
proviso to  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_97">Section 10(2)</a>  (xiv) and  s.35(2) (iv)  is	that
both the deductions cannot be claimed "for the same previous
year" in  respect of  the same	capital	 asset.	 The  second
limitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso  to <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_98">Section
10(2)</a> (xiv)  and s.35(2)  (v) which  say that  if a  capital
asset used  for scientific research ceases to be so used but
is thereafter  brought into a  business for use therein, the
actual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect
of the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its
original cost  reduced by  the amount  of deductions allowed
under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_99">Section  10(2)</a> (xiv)  or s.35(2).	 In other words, the
contention of the assessee was and is that both the types of
allowances are	permissible under  the statute except to the
extent limited	by clauses  (d) and  (e) of  the proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_100">Section 10(2)</a>  (xiv) of	 the  1922  Act	 and  reproduced  in
clauses (iv) and (v) of	 <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_101">Section 35(2)</a> of the 1961 Act.
</p><p id="p_17">     Before us	it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that
this interpretation  of the  statutory	provisions  is	very
clear, patent  and unambiguous.	 It is	alleged that despite
this, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim
of depreciation	 in respect  of such  capital assets even in
previous years	during which  no deduction  was	 claimed  or
allowed under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_102">Section 10(2)</a> (xiv) or <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_103">Section 35(2)</a>, contrary
to the	clear language	of clause  (d) of  s.10(2) (xiv) and
s.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either
by the	Appellate Commissioner	or by  the Tribunal.  It was
suggested that	these decisions	 were almost  unanimously in
favour of  the assessee	 but the   department  persisted  in
pursuing the  matter upto  the stage of the High Court. Only
one reference  on this	topic came up before the High Courts
and is	reflected in  the decision  of	the  Karnataka	High
Court, reported	 as <a href="/doc/1636268/" id="a_104">CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd</a>.,
(1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977
made at	 the instance  of the Commissioner of Income Tax and
the Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High
(Sourt	re-affirmed   the  position  contended	for  by	 the
assessee as  the one and only possible interpretation of the
statutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there
was, and  could have  been, no	doubt that  an assessee	 was
entitled to  claim depreciation allowance in respect of such
assets in  respect of  previous years  other than  those  in
which an  allowance   had been allowed under the other head.
We shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.
</p><p id="p_18">     At this stage, the <a href="/doc/227413/" id="a_105">Finance (No.2) Act</a>, 1980 intervened.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">     "(iv) where  a deduction is allowed

assessments. The  effect will be not for one assessment year
but for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting
a very	grim picture  of the  consequences  of	giving	full
retrospective effect  to the  amendment, the  assessees	 say
that it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them
over the  years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open
to action  by creditor	and financial  institutions. Such an
onerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable
and  oppressive	 and  the  provision  imposing	such  burden
violates the  fundamental  rights  of  the  assessees  under
Articles 14  and 19(1)	(g) of the Constitution of India. It
is on  this plea  that, even  though assessments and appeals
are pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose
to approach  this Court	 by  way  of  writ  petitions  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_111">Article 32</a>  of	the  Constitution.  These  are	mostly	writ
petitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing
after a period of 10 years.
</p><p id="p_20">     Learned counsel  for the  assessees do  not contest the
competence  of	 the  legislature   to	enact  the  impugned
provision, nor	do they dispute the right of the legislature
to give	 retrospective effect  to statutory  provisions. The
contention only	 is that  retrospective	 provisions  may  be
permissible   even in  taxing statutes	in  certain  special
circumstances such  as in  the case of provisions clarifying
the  impact   of  a  statute,  provisions  curing  defective
legislations in	 the light of the judicial decisions and the
like. They,  however, say that if the legislature chooses to
impose a  totally new  burden,	which  was  not	 at  all  in
contemplation	earlier	   and	 proceeds   to	 give	full
retrospective effect  thereto, such  an	 attempt  should  be
struck	down   as    unreasonable  and	discriminatory.	 The
principal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">     1)	 Were	the  earlier   statutory
     provisions capable	 of  only    one
     interpretation, namely, that placed
     by the  assessees or  was there any
     ambiguity in relation thereto ?
     (2) If  there  was	 some  doubt  or
     ambiguity	 about	  the	 earlier
     legislation,  and	 the  1980   Act
     clarified	 the   position	  by   a
     retrospective amendment,  would  it
     offend  the   provisions	of   the
     Constitution ?</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     (3) If,  on  the  other  hand,  the
     earlier provision	was  very  clear
     and    capable    of    only    one
     interpretation, as	 placed	 by  the
     assessee,	 was   the   legislature
     within its	 rights in  amending the
     provision	retrospectively	  w.e.f.
     1.4.62   and   thus   imposing   an
     unreasonable  tax	 burden	 on  the
     assessees?</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     Taking up	the first  of the three questions, it has to
be considered  from two	 angles, one  factual and the other,
legal. An  attempt was	made on behalf of the petitioners to
project an  image as  if the  interpretation  sought  to  be
placed by  the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow
depreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never
received the  approval of  the higher appellate authorities.
It was	suggested that	the appeals by assessees against the
disallowance invariably	 succeeded and it was the Department
that had  to move  the High Court on reference, the first of
which references came up before the Karnataka High Court in
C.l.<a href="/doc/57628/" id="a_112">T. v.  Indian Telephone  Industries</a>	 (1980)	 126  I.T.R.
548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of
such allegations  the petitioners attempted to make out that
the Department's  interpretation was  patently untenable and
that the  1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory
clarification of  an ambiguity	but a  totally new and fresh
imposition sought  to be  unjustifiably given  retrospective
effect.
</p><p id="p_22">     But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of
the averments  of the  petitioner in one of the cases, viz.,
W.P.1153/81, the  impression sought  to be  created  by	 the
petitioners does  not accord  with the	correct	 facts.	 The
position in  the case  is available  only as it stood at the
time when  the writ  petition and the counter affidavit were
filed	and   subsequent   developments	  are	not   known.
Nevertheless, the  picture that	 emerges is  this.  In	that
case, the  Income-tax  Officer	(I.T.O.)  is  said  to	have
allowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research,
for the	 assessment year  1969-70, though  this is denied by
the department.	 The claim  was perhaps	 disallowed  by	 the
I.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed
by the	Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal
(I.T.A.T.) by  its order  dated 30.8.76.  For the assessment
year 1971-72,  the I.T.O.  disallowed the  depreciation. The
Appellate Assistant  Commissioner (A.A.C.)  allowed it.	 The
department appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which
accepted the department's plea by its order dated 13.8.79
 placing  reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the
I.T.A.T. It  has been  stated that  the	 assessee  filed  an
application for	 reference  to	the  High  Court  which	 was
pending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment
years 1972-73  to 1974-75,  the assessments are pending as a
stay order  had been  obtained for  reasons  which  are	 not
known. For  the assessment  years 1975-76  and 1976-77,	 the
assessee claimed  depreciation	on  a  number  of  items  of
scientific research  assets. The I.T.O. "allowed" the claims
subject to  the rider  that "there  is no  provision to give
deduction of  more than	 100% of  the expenditure  by way of
depreciation". The  assessee  appealed	to  Commissioner  of
Income-tax (Appeals)  who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78,
the l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the
assessee's appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81,
the assessments	 are stated  to be  pending. The above facts
are sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there
is no  information before  us as  to  the  position  between
1.4.1946 and  31.3.1968 -  the Department  has been  putting
forward its  objections on  the issue  and that the same was
the subject  matter  of	 controversy  at  various  appellate
stages, some  decided in  favour of,  and some	against, the
assessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided
the issue  against the	assessee. In  this background, it is
not correct  to say  that the position was crystal clear and
that, save  for a  few ITOs  who took  a biassed  view,	 the
authorities were  all agreed that the Department's stand was
untenable. Some	 of the	 reported decisions  also show	that
there was  a live  controversy and that references have been
made to	 the  High  Court  both	 at  the  instances  or	 the
assessees [see	<a href="/doc/677320/" id="a_113">Alkali &amp;  Chemical Corporation of India Ltd.
v. C</a>.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and <a href="/doc/1425228/" id="a_114">C.I.T. v. Indian
Explosives Ltd</a>.,  (1992) 192  I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as
at the instance of the Revenue [see, <a href="/doc/684391/" id="a_115">C.I.T. v. International
Instruments P. Ltd</a>., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); <a href="/doc/147935/" id="a_116">C.I.T. v.
Mahindra Sintered Products Ltd</a>. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.)
and <a href="/doc/1822608/" id="a_117">Warner  Hindustan Ltd.  v. CIT</a>,  (1988) 171	 I.T.R.	 224
(A.P.)]. The petitioner's contention that, under the
 pre-amended  provisions, depreciation	on such	 assets	 was
recognised  allround   as  clearly  allowable  is  therefore
rejected. We  have dealt  with this  aspect only  to meet an
aspect that  was urged. What is really important is the true
and correct  interpretation of	those provisions,  not	what
someone thought	 of it	then and to this aspect we shall now
turn.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">4</span>
<p id="p_23">     The second	 aspect of  the First of the three questions
posed  earlier	 for  our  consideration  is  the  legal  or
interpretational aspect	 of the	 provisions  as	 they  stood
prior to  the 1980  Amendment. Under  the provisions  of the
statute as  they stood	earlier, could	the  assessees	have
claimed continued  grant of depreciation after the expiry of
five previous  years before the 1968 amendment and after the
expiry or  the first  year after  the 1968  amendment,	even
though the  entire cost of the capital asset in question had
been allowed  to  be  written  off  completely	against	 the
business  profits  of  those  five  previous  years  or	 one
previous year  as the  case may	 be? We	 think the answer to
this question  must emphatically  be in the negative. In our
view, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having
envisaged  a   double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same
expenditure, even  though it  is true  that the two heads of
deduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some
difference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under
consideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed
on the	following circumstances to support a contention that
the statute  did not  intend one  deduction to	preclude the
other :
</p><p id="p_24">     (i) lt  is pointed	 out that  s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922
Act, was  inserted in  1946 consequent on the insertion of a
corresponding  provision   in  the   United  Kingdom.	That
provision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944
 read thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     (4) Where	a deduction  is	 allowed
     for any  year under  this	 or  the
     last preceding  section in	 respect
     of expenditure   represented wholly
     or	 partly	  by  any   assets,   no
     deduction	 shall be  allowed under
     any provisions  of	 the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_118">Income-tax
     Act</a> other	than this  part of  this
     Act in  respect of	 wear and  tear,
     obsolescence,    depreciation    or
     exceptional depreciation  of  these
     assets for	 any year  of assessment
     during any	 part of  which they are
     used by  the person carrying on the
     trade   for   scientific	research
     related to the trade. "
</blockquote><p id="p_25">	  (emphasis supplied)
     The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate
departure from	the said  provision and	 limited the  bar of
depreciation only  to those  previous years  during which  a
deduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);
</p><p id="p_26">     (ii) When	the Income-tax	Bill,  1961  was  under	 the
consideration of  the  Law  Commission,	 the  provisions  of
S.10(2) (vi)  and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes
were made  and the  provisions of the new Act in this regard
were drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;
</p><p id="p_27">     (iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to
S.10(2)	 (xiv)	and  S.35(2)  (iv)  again  is  significantly
different from the language used in various other provisions
of the	Act which,  in	like  contexts	of  possible  double
allowances, emphatically  rule out  deductions in respect of
the same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income
under two  different provisions	 for the  same or  even	 any
other assessment  year :  See, for  example, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_119">Sections  20(2)</a>
<a href="/doc/1197551/" id="a_120">35B(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1821644/" id="a_121">35C(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1832927/" id="a_122">35CC(4)</a>, <a href="/doc/347769/" id="a_123">35CCA(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/1843284/" id="a_124">35CCB(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/1690841/" id="a_125">35D(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/319540/" id="a_126">35E(8)</a>,

</p><p id="p_28">     (iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation
shall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a
disallowance only  in those  previous years  and  means,  by
necessary implication,	that it	 shall be  allowed  in other
years,	if   otherwise	eligible  on  the  language  of	 the
provision for depreciation.
</p><p id="p_29">     There  is	 an  apparent	plausibility   about   these
arguments,  particularly  in  the  context  of	the  alleged
departure in  the language  used by  S.10(2)(xiv)  from that
employed in  S.20 of  the U.K.	Finance Act,  1944. We	may,
however, point out that the last few underlined words of the
English statute	 show that  there is  really  no  difference
between the  English and  <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_131">Indian Act</a>s;	the former  also  in
terms prohibits	 depreciation only so long as the assets are
used for  scientific research.	In our	opinion,  the  other
provisions of  the Act	to which  reference has	 been made -
some of	 which were  inserted  after the present controversy
started -  are not  helpful and we have to construe the real
scope of  the provisions  with which  we are  concerned.  We
think  that  all  misconception	 will  vanish  and  all	 the
provisions will	 fall into  place, if  we  hear	 in  mind  a
fundamental, through  unwritten, axiom	that no	 legislature
could have  at all  intended a double deduction in regard to
the   same business  outgoing, and if it is intended it will
be clearly  expressed. In  other words,	 in the	 absence  of
clear statutory	 indication to	the  contrary,	the  statute
should	not  be	 read  so  as  to  permit  an  assessee	 two
deductions both	 under S.10(2)	(vi) and S.10(2) (xiv) under
the 1922  Act or under S.32(1)(ii) and 35(2)(iv) of the 1922
Act - qua the same expenditure. Is then the use of the words
"in respect of the same previous year" in clause  (d) of the
proviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  of the 1922 Act and<a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_132"> S. 35(2)</a> (iv)
of  the	  1961	Act  a	contra-indication  which  permits  a
disallowance of	 depreciation only  in the previous years in
which the  other allowance is actually allowed. We think the
answer is an emphatic `no' and that the purpose of the words
above referred to is totally different. If, as contended for
by the assessees,  there can be no objection in principle to
allowances being  made under  both the	provisions as  their
nature	and   purpose  are  different,	then  the  interdict
disallowing a  double deduction	 will be meaningless even in
respect of the previous years for which deduction is allowed
under S.10(2)  (xiv) /S.35  in respect of the same asset. If
that  were   the  correct  principle,  The  assessee  should
logically be  entitled to  deduction by	 way of depreciation
for all	  previous years including those for which allowance
have been granted under the provision relating to scientific
research. The  statute does not permit this. The restriction
imposed would,	therefore, be  illogical and  unjustified on
the basis  suggested by the assessees. On the other hand, if
we accept  the principle we have outlined earlier viz. that,
there is  a basic  legislative scheme,	unspoken but clearly
underlying the	Act, that  two allowances cannot be, and are
not intended  to be, granted in respect of the same asset or
expenditure, one  will easily  see  the	 necessity  for	 the
limitation imposed  by the  quoted words. For, in this view,
where the  capital asset is one of the nature specified, the
assessee can  get only one of the two allowances in question
but not both. Then the question would arise and might create
a difficulty  : in  that event,	 which not the two allowance
should the  assessee be	 granted -  that which	the assessee
chooses or that which the assessing officer might prefer? It
is necessary for the statute to define this and this is what
has been  done by  the rider in clause (d) of the proviso to
S.10 (2)  (xiv)/S.35(2) (iv).  It mandates that the assessee
should, in such a case, be granted the special allowance for
scientific research  and not  the routine and annual one for
depreciation. Clause (d) of the proviso to S.10(2) (xiv) and
S.30(2) (iv)  thus fall	 into place  as an  appropriate	 and
necessary provision.  The provision  contained in clause (e)
of the	proviso to S.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922 Act, re-enacted
in Explanation, to S.43 (1) of the 1961 Act, also reinforces
this line  of approach.	 It  provides  that  the  extent  of
capital expenditure  written off  under the  second  of	 the
above headings	(whether it  be	 ]00%  under  the  post-1968
provision or  20%, 40%,	 60%, 80% or 100% under the pre-1968
provision) has	to be pro-tanto deducted in ascertaining the
actual cost  for purposes  of depreciation.  This  provision
militates, in  our view, against the petitioners, contention
that the  allowances under  the two provisions are by nature
unconnected with, and independent of, each other. Its effect
is this.  Suppose a  person uses  an  asset  for  scientific
research for  sometime and  then brings it into his business
for other  use later,  he would	 be thereafter	entitled  to
depreciation thereon  only on the actual cost less deduction
allowed under  S.10 (2)	 (xiv)/S.35. However,  if the  asset
continues to  be used  in scientific research related to the
business, he  would be	entitled to  get depreciation on its
full cost  after the  first few	 previous years during which
allowance is  granted under  those provisions. This seems to
be anomalous  but Shri	Ganesh says that there is no anomaly
because	 this	is  a	provision  intended   to  act  as  a
disincentive to	 persons who  purport to purchase assets for
scientific research  but withdraw  it  from  such  use	soon
after. Granted	that this  is so, still the deduction of the
allowances given on scientific research assets for computing
depreciation is consistent only with the principle stated by
us that	 they are  deductions basically	 of the	 same nature
intended to  enable the	 assessee to write off certain items
of capital  expenditure against his business profits. We may
add that  the report  of the Chocksi Committee, on the basis
of which  the 1980-amendment  was effected  only echoed	 the
same view when it said in para 3.29 of its report :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">     "3.29 Our	attention has  also been
     drawn   to	  certain      anomalous
     situations	  in   the   matter   of
     allowance	of     depreciation.  In
     certain   cases	where	a   full
     deduction has     been  allowed  in
     relation to  a capital  asset under
     other   sections (as  for	example,
     <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_133">section   35</a>    which   permits   a
     deduction	in  respect  of	 capital
     expenditure     for      scientific
     research),	  the	taxpayers   have
     contended that  such deduction   is
     independent of  the   allowance  by
     way of  depreciation. In  our view,
     the intention of the legislature is
     not to  allow a   double  deduction
     (of 200%)	in respect  of the  same
     asset,   once under <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_134">section 35</a> and,
     again,  by	  way  of   depreciation
     under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_135">section  32</a>. If  and	 to  the
     extent that  there is  any	 anomaly
     or	 contrary  view	 possible  on  a
     construction of	 <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_136">section 35</a>,  we
     recommend that  the law  should  be
     clarified	   to  provide	that  no
     depreciation under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_137">section 32</a> shall
     be	 allowable in respect of capital
     expenditure     for      scientific
     research qualifying  for  deduction
     under	   <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_138">section	    35</a>."</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">     For the  reasons discussed	 above, we  are of  the view
that, even  before   the 1980-amendment,  the  Act  did	 not
permit a  deduction for	 depreciation in respect of the cost
of a  capital asset  acquired  for  purposes  of  scientific
research to  the extent such cost has been written off under
S.10(2) (xiv)/35  (1) &amp;	 (2). Prior  to	 1968,	such  assets
qualified for  an allowance  of one-fifth of the cost of the
asset in  five previous	 years starting	 with  that  of	 its
acquisition and	 during these  years the  assessee could not
get any	 depreciation in  relation thereto.  In	 respect  of
assets acquired in previous year relevant to assessment year
1968-69 and  thereafter, their	cost was  written off in the
previous year  of acquisition  and no  depreciation could be
allowed in  that year.	This  is  clear	 from  the  statute.
Equally, it  is not  envisaged,	 and  indeed,  it  would  be
meaningless to	say, that  depreciation could be  allowed on
them thereafter	 with a	 further absurdity  that it could be
allowed starting with the original cost of the asset despite
its user  for scientific  research and	the allowances	made
under the  'scientific research'  clause. In our view, there
was no	difficulty at  all  in	the  interpretation  of	 the
provisions. The	 mere fact  that a baseless claim was raised
by some	 over-enthusiastic assessees  who  sought  a  double
allowance or  that such claim may perhaps have been accepted
by some	 authorities is	 not  sufficient  to  attribute	 any
ambiguity or doubt as to the true scope of the provisions as
they stood earlier. We are, for the reasons discussed above,
unable to  approve of  the cryptic  view  expressed  by	 the
Karnataka  High	  Court	 in   <a href="/doc/1636268/" id="a_139">C.I.T.  v.   Indian  Telephone
Industries Ltd</a>.,  (1980) 126 I.T.R. 548 or the view taken by
the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/934411/" id="a_140">C.I.T. v. Hico Products</a>, (1991) 187
I.T.R. 517.
</p><p id="p_31">     In view of the answer given by us to the first question
posed by us, there is no need to answer the second and third
questions since,  even without	the amendment, the assessees
cannot claim  the depreciation	allowance in  question.	 The
second question	 can arise  only if it is assumed that there
was an	ambiguity or  doubt as	to interpretation  that	 was
retrospectively clarified  by the  legislature.	 But  it  is
common ground  before us  that, even on this hypothesis, the
validity of  the amendment  cannot be  challenged.  This  is
indeed beyond  all doubt:  <a href="/doc/1216757/" id="a_141">See Rai  Ramkrishna v.  State  of
Bihar</a>, [1964]  1 S.C.R. 897; <a href="/doc/1180216/" id="a_142">Asst Commissioner of Urban Land

India</a>, (1984)  148 I.T.R.  644.	 Even  the  Bombay  decision
inC.l.T. v.  Hico Products,  (1991) 187	 I.T.R. 517 on which
the  assessees	 heavily  rely,	 concedes,  in	our  opinion
rightly, this position. The assessees may have some possible
case only if the earlier statutory provisions can be said to
have been  unambiguously in  favour of	the assessee and the
1980 amendment	had radically altered the provisions to cast
a  new	 and  substantial   burden  on	 the  assessee	with
retrospective  effect.	 It  is	  this	third	alternative,
reflected by  the third	 question  posed  by  us,  that	 was
success fully  urged before the High Court by the assessees.
But we	are unable to accept this argument or conclusion. In
our view,  the first  question has  to be answered by saying
that the  pre-1980  provisions	were  capable  of  only	 one
interpretation but  that was  as  urged	 on  behalf  of	 the
Revenue. The 1980-amendment has effected no change at all in
the  provision	 except	 to   set  out	 more  clearly	 and
categorically what  the provision said even earlier. In this
view, the  second and  third questions	earlier posed do not
arise.

<p id="p_36">     Learned Counsel for the petitioners-assessees contended
that the  retrospective effect	given to  the said amendment

pay huge  amounts by  way of tax. Such payment, if enforced,
has the	 effect of  debilitating the  assessees,  industries

besides the guarantee in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_150">Article 300A.</a>
</p><p id="p_37">     In the  year 1946, clause (xiv) among other clauses was
introduced in  sub-section (2)	of <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_151">Section  10</a> of the Indian
Income-tax Act,	 1922. It provided, for the first time, that
even expenditure  of a capital nature laid out on scientific
research related  to the  business of  the assessee shall be
allowed to  be deducted.  The deduction was hundred per cent
spread over  a period  of five	consecutive  previous  years
commencing from	 the previous  year on which the expenditure
was incurred. Sub-clause (d) of clause (xiv) provided at the
same time  that	 "where	 a  deduction  is  allowed  for	 any
previous year  under this  clause in  respect of expenditure
represented wholly  or partly  by any  asset,  no  deduction
shall be  allowed under	 clause(vi) or	clause (vii) for the
same previous  year in respect of that asset." The effect of
sub-clause (d)	was that  if an	 assessee  claimed  and	 was
allowed a  deduction in	 respect of expenditure of a capital
nature on  scientific research, - and where such expenditure
took the shape of an asset, which in the normal course would
be entitled  to deduction  on account  of depreciation under
clauses (vi)  and (vii)	 of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_152">Section  10(2)</a> - no depreciation
would  be   allowed  in	 respect  of  that  asset  in  those
respective previous years. In other words, during the period
of  five   previous  years  the	 assessee  was	allowed	 the
deduction under	 clause (xiv)  of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_153">section
10</a>, claim for depreciation under clauses (vi) an/or (vii) of
the same sub-section was excluded.
</p><p id="p_38">     <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_154">In the  Income-tax Act</a>,  1961, a  similar provision was
made in	 <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_155">section 35</a>.  Clause  (iv)  of	sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_156">section 35</a>  provided  for  deduction  of  expenditure  of  a
capital nature	incurred on  scientific research  related to
the business  carried on by the assessee. Sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_157">Section 35</a> set out the manner in which and the terms subject
to which  the deduction	 was to	 be allowed.  As enacted  in
1961, sub-section  (2) provided,  - as	was done  by  clause
</p><p id="p_39">(xiv) of  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_158">Section 10(2)</a>	 of the	 1922 Act  - that  the	said
deduction  shall   be  allowed	in  equal  measure  in	five
consecutive previous  years, commencing	 from  the  previous
year in	 which the  expenditure was  incurred. In  the	year
1967, however,	sub-section (2)	 was amended,  providing for
full deduction	of the expenditure in the very previous year
in which  such expenditure  was incurred. Clause (iv) of sub
section	 (2),	however,  remained  unchanged.	Clause	(iv)
declares that  where a deduction is allowed for any previous
year under  the	 said  section	in  respect  of	 expenditure
represented wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction shall
be allowed  under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section
(I) or	under sub-section  (1A) of  <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_159">section 32</a>	for the same
previous year  in respect  of that asset. Thus, the position
obtaining under	 the 1922  Act and  the previous  Act is the
same, with  the	 difference  that  if  such  expenditure  is
incurred after April 1, 1967, hundred per cent deduction was
granted in  the	 very  previous	 year  in  which  the  asset
(representing  the   capital  expenditure   of	the   nature
mentioned in  clause (iv)  of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_160">Section 35</a>)
is acquired.
</p><p id="p_40">     The Revenue says that the deduction provided by <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_161">Section
35(1)</a> (iv)  is in  the alternative to the deduction provided
by clauses  (i), (ii)  and (iii) of sub-section (1) and sub-
section (1A)  of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_162">Section 32</a>. If one is availed of, the other
is not available, not only during the year or years in which
the deduction  under <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_163">Section  35(1)</a> (iv)  is availed of, but
permanently. The  reason, according  to them, is obvious: if
both are  allowed to  be availed  of, it amounts to grant of
200% deduction	viz., 100%  under Section-35  (1)  (iv)	 and
another 100%  under sub-sections (1) and (1A) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_164">Section 32</a>.
This is	  totally outside the contemplation of the Act, they
say. On	 the other  hand, the case of the asssessees is that
the bar	 created by  clause (iv)  of sub-section (2) applies
only to	 that previous	year or	 those previous years during
which the  said expenditure  is allowed as a deduction. That
is the	express language  of the  clause. The  bar does	 not
extend beyond the year or years in which the deduction under
<a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_165">Section 35(1)</a>  (iv) is availed. There is no reason - more so
in a  taxing enactment	- to  extend the said bar beyond the
limit prescribed  by the statute. They say, if the intention
of the	Parliament was	to bar	the claim of depreciation in
respect of  such asset	for all	 time to  come, nothing	 was
easier than  to say  so in  clear words,  as was done by sub
section (4),  of section 20 of U.K. Finance Act, 1944. It is
pointed out  that clause (xiv) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_166">section
10</a> was	introduced in  the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_167">Indian  Income-tax Act</a> within two
years of  the introduction  of a  similar provision  in	 the
<a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_168">English Act</a>,  evidently inspired  by the  Amendment  in	 the
<a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_169">English Act</a>.  But while	 incorporating the said provision, a
conscious, departure was made by the Indian Legislature, say
the assessees.	Having regard  to the  scant  investment  in
scientific  research   in  India,   it	is   submitted,	 the
legislature must  have thought	it necessary  to provide  an
additional  inducement	over  and  above  the  deduction  on
account of  depreciation. Considerations  of equity  have no
place in  the interpretation  of a  taxing  enactments, they
say further.
</p><p id="p_41">     I find  it difficult to agree with the reasoning of the
assessees.  Acceding  to  it  would  amount  to	 placing  an
unreasonable interpretation upon the relevant provisions and
to negating the intention of Parliament. I find it difficult
to  agree   that  the  Indian  Legislature  -  as  also	 the
Parliament   made a  conscious departure  from	the  English
Amendment with	the idea  of providing an additional benefit
to induce  the Indian assessees to invest more in scientific
research. I  find the  argument rather	convoluted.  If	 the
intention of  the Legislature/Parliament was to provide more
than 100%  deduction, they  would have said so, as they have
done in	 cases	where  they  provided  for  what  is  called
weighted deduction'. (For example, See <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_170">Section 35(B)</a> of 1961
Act). A double deduction cannot be a matter of inference, it
must be	 provided for  in clear and express language. regard
having to  its unusual	nature and its serious impact on the
Revenues of the State. Now, what does clause (iv) of <a href="/doc/1183591/" id="a_171">Section
35(2)</a> say?  It says  that during  the years  or the  year in
which the  assessee avails  of the  deduction under  <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_172">Section
35</a>(1 )	(iv) he	 shall not avail of the deduction on account
of   depreciation provided by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of
sub-section (1)	 and sub-section  (1A) of  <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_173">Section 32</a>.	What
could be  the underlying  reason? It  is obviously to ensure
that the  assessee doesn't get double deduction. Take a case
where the  asset was  acquired prior  to April	1,1957.	 The
deduction under	 <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_174">Section 35(1)</a> (iv) would be allowed in five
consecutive years.  If during  the very five previous years,
depreciation under  the aforementioned	provisions  is	also
allowed, the  assessee would  obtain, at  the  end  of	five
years, a double depreciation i.e., 100% under <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_175">Section 35</a> and
almost 100%  under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_176">Section 32</a>. (It may be noted that in many
cases, the  rate of  depreciation under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_177">Section 32</a> is 20% or
even higher).  If such	a course  was barred  by clause (iv)
during the initial five years, would it be reasonable to say
that same  thing can  be achieved  by claiming the deduction
after the  expiry of  five years? If both the deductions are
in the	alternative, as	 indicated by clause (iv), they must
be  understood	 as  being   in	 the   alternative  and	 not
consecutive. It	 would be  a rather curious thing to say (in
the case  of an	 asset acquired prior to April 1, 1967) that
Parliament barred  claim for  depreciation under  <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_178">Section 32</a>
even in	 the first  year when  only 20%	 of the	 cost of the
asset is  allowed as  deduction under <a href="/doc/947986/" id="a_179">Section 35(1)</a> (iv), it
barred it  in the  second, third  and fourth years, when the
deduction has  reached 40, 60 and 80 per cent, but permitted
it be claimed after the fifth year, by which year the entire
100% cost  was allowed	as a deduction. No express provision
was necessary  to say what is so obvious. The position after
April 1, 1967 is no different.
</p><p id="p_42">     That the aforesaid view is the correct one is indicated
by  Explanation	 (1)  to  clause  (1)  of  <a href="/doc/394567/" id="a_180">section  43</a>	[the
corresponding provision in the 1922 Act being sub-clause (e)
of clause  (xiv) of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_181">Section 10(2)</a>]. Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/394567/" id="a_182">section 43</a>
defines	 the   expression  `actual  cost'.  Explanation	 (1)
appended , to the definition says "Where an asset is used in
the business  after it	ceases to  be  used  for  scientific
research related  to that business and a deduction has to be
made under  clause (ii)	 of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_183">section 32</a> in
respect of  that asset,	 the actual cost of the asset to the
assessee shall be the actual cost to the assessee as reduced
by the	amount of any deduction allowed under clause (iv) of
sub-section (1)	 of <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_184">section  35</a> or  under any  corresponding
provision of  the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_185">Indian Income-tax Act</a>, 1922 (11 of 1922)."
Now what  does this  mean? Take	 a case where the asset of a
like nature  acquired prior  to April 1, 1967 is diverted to
other purposes	after the  expiry of two previous years; the
`actual cost'  of the  asset to	 the assessee in such a case
would be  60% of  the original	cost. And  if it is diverted
after five  years, it  would be	 nil which  means  that	 the
assessee cannot	 claim any  depreciation    on	it  at	all.
Counsel for the assessee explains this provision to say that
it was	meant to  prevent diversion  of such  an asset	from
scientific research  to assessee's  business  purposes.	 The
explanation does  not stand  scrutiny. The  fallacy  in	 the
explanation can	 be demonstrated  by taking  the  very	same
illustration, where  the asset is acquired prior to April 1,
1967. Suppose,	 such  an asset	 is diverted after first two
previous years,	 its `actual  cost' to the assessee would be
60% of	the original  cost, which  alone would	qualify	 for
deduction under	 <a href="/doc/1004921/" id="a_186">Section 32(1)</a>	and (1A).  The remaining 40%
would not.  This 40%  goes without earning any depreciation.
Why is it so, if the assessees are right in saying what they
do. According  to  their  reasoning,  this  40%	 too  should
qualify for  depreciation. The	fallacy	 in  their  argument
would become  clearer, if the diversion is at the end of the
fifth year.
</p><p id="p_43">     That the  Parliament never	 intended to  provide for  a
double deduction  is also  the opinion of the Direct Tax Law
Committee. In  its  interim  report,  (December,  1977)	 the
Committee (popularly  known as	'Choksi Committee') had this
to say in para 3.29 of its report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">     "3.29.- Our attention has also been
     drawn    to    certain    anomalous
     situations	  in   the   matter   of

     certain   cases	where	a   full
     deduction	has   been  allowed   in
     relation to  a capital  asset under
     other  sections  (as  for	example,

     contended that  such  deduction  is
     independent of the allowance by way
     of depreciation.  In our  view, the

     depreciation under <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_191">section 32</a> shall
     be allowable  in respect of capital
     expenditure for  scientificresearch
     qualifying	 for   deduction   under
     <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_192">section 35</a>."</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">     lt is  evidently on  the basis  of this  recommendation
that clause  (iv) of  sub-section  (2)	of  <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_193">section  35</a>	 was
amended to  make  express  what	 was  implicit	in  it.	 The
amendment introduced  the words	 "or any  other" in the said
clause. After amendment, clause (iv) of <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_194">section 35</a> (2) reads
as follows:  "where a  deduction is allowed for any previous
year  under   this  section   in  respect   of	 expenditure
represented wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction shall
be allowed  under clause  (ii) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_195">section
32</a> for	the same  or any  other previous  year in respect of
that asset."  In our  opinion the  said amendment  is merely
clarificatory in nature. It makes explicit what was implicit
in  the	  provisions.  Question	 of  its  constitutionality,
therefore,  does   not	arise.	 Though	 purporting   to  be
retrospective, it  does not  take away	any rights which had
legally vested in the assessees.
</p><p id="p_45">     The  Bombay   High	 Court	has  struck  down  the	said
amendment of  clause (iv)  in <a href="/doc/934411/" id="a_196">Commissioner  of Income Tax v.
Hico Products Pvt. Ltd</a>., 187 I.T.R. 517. The approach of the
Bombay	High   Court  is  at  variance	with  ours.  It	 has
practically accepted  the line	of reasoning  put forward by
the assessees  which has  not commended	 to us.	 Among other
reasons, the  High Court  was impressed by the difference in
the language  employed in  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_197">Section 10(2)(xiv)(d)</a> and the one
employed in  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_198">Section 20</a>	 (4) of	 the U.K.Finance  Act, which
reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">     "(4) Where	 a deduction  is allowed
     for any year under this or the last
     preceding	section	 in  respect  of
     expenditure represented  wholly  or
     partly by	any assets, no deduction
     shall   be	   allowed   under   any
     provisions of  the	 <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_199">Income-tax  Act</a>
     other than this part of this Act in
     respect   of    wear   and	   tear,
     absolescence,    depreciation    or
     exceptional depreciation  of  these
     assets for	 any year  of assessment
     during any	 part of  which they are
     used by  the person carrying on the
     trade   for   scientific	research
     related	 to	 the	 trade."</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">     It is  apparent that  the scheme  and structure  of the
English provision  is  different  than	ours,  as  has	been
demonstrated by my learned brother G Ranganathan, J.
</p><p id="p_47">     So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights
is concerned,  it is  evident from  the facts  stated in the
writ petition  1153/81 - which was treated as representative
of the	facts and  contentions in all the writ petitions and
with reference	to  which  facts  were	arguments  addressed
itself that  none of  the assessments relating to any of the
assessment years concerned herein has become final. They are
pending at  one or  the other  stage and in one or the other
forum. I  need not  dilate upon	 this aspect inasmuch as the
impugned amendment  merely makes  explicit what was implicit
in the unamended clause, as explained hereinabove. In such a
situation,  the	  argument  of	any  right  vesting  in	 the
assessees is misplaced.
</p><p id="p_48"> The writ petitions accordingly fail and are dismissed.
No costs.
