HEADNOTE:
Under the U.P. Sales Tax Act 1948 as it originally stood the
purchases  of  split  or processed  foodgrains	and  dal  by
dealers were sought to be brought to tax under<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_6"> s. 3-D</a> of the
principal  Act read with the notification issued. in a	writ
petition  relating  to the assessment  year  1966-67  (<a href="/doc/370370/" id="a_7">Tilok
Chand Prasan Kumar v. Sale Tax Officer, Hathras</a> 25 STC	118)
the  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding
that  the dal purchased by the petitioner could not be	said
to  be a commodity essentially different from the arhar	 dal
purchased  by  the dal mills and accordingly  the  purchases
effected  by  the petitioner could not be  regarded  as	 the
first purchases.  Thereafter the Governor of U.P. issued the
Uttar	Pradesh	  Sale	Tax   (Amendment   and	 Validation)
Ordinance,, 1970 adding inter alia Explanation to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_8"> s. 3-D</a>  as
well  as a validating provision viz. s. 7 to  the  principal
Act.  The ordinance, was later enacted as the Uttar  Pradesh
Sales	Tax  Act  (Amendment  and  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_9">Validation)	 Act</a>   1970.
Explanation  II aforesaid provided that split  or  processed
foodgrains     such as in the form of dal shall be deemed to
be different from unsplit     or unprocessed foodgrains	 and
accordingly tax could be levied on first purchases of  split
dal.  In support of the writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Art. 226</a> of	 the
Constitution  filed in the High Court by the  appellant	 the
validity  of Explanation 11 of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_11"> s. 3-D</a> as well as<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_12"> s.  7</a>	was
challenged   and  it  was  contended  that  the	  amendments
incorporated  were not effective enough to bring to tax	 the
first purchase of split or processed foodgrains and  pulses.
The High Court rejected these contentions and dismissed	 the
writ  petition.	  There	 after	these  recent  appeals	were
brought with certificates,
Dismissing the appeals.
HELD : (i) The source of the legislative power to levy sales
of  purchases  tax on goods is Entry 54 of List	 II  of	 the
Constitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to
constitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a
power to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.
In Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel it was specifically decided by
this Court that where the legislature can make a valid	law,
it can provide net only for the prospective operation of the
material provisions of the said law but it can also  provide
for the retrospective operation of the said provisions.	 The
contention   that   no	fresh  levy  can   be	imposed	  by
retrospective  legislation must therefore be rejected.	[509

[1962]	Supp. 2 S.C.R., p. 1 and Sri Ramkrishna: &amp;  Ors.  v.
The State of Bihar, [1964] 1 S.C.R. 897, applied.
(ii)  It is open to the legislature to define the nature  of
the  goods, the sale or purchase of which should be  brought
to  tax..  Legislature was not incompetent to  separate	 the
processed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed
pulses and treat the two as separate and independent  goods.
There  was no basis for the contention that the	 legislature
cannot	for  the purpose of tax under the Act  separate	 the
split or processed from the unsplit or unprocessed. [510A-<a href="/doc/436116/" id="a_17">D]
Jagannath  and Ors. v. Union of India</a>, [1962] 2 S.C.R.	118,
referred to.
(iii)	  There was no justification for the contention that
the  legislature  had  usurped any  judicial  power.   The
legislature   had  not	purported  either  directly  or	  by
implication  to overrule the decision of the Allahabad	High
Court  in Tilok Chand Prasan Kumar's case On the other	hand
it had accepted that decision as correct; but had sought  to
remove	the  basis  of	that  decision	by   retrospectively
changing  the  law.  Encroachment on the judicial  power  is
outside	  the	competence  of	the  legislature   but	 the
nullification  of  the	effect of  a  judicial	decision  by
changing the law retrospectively, is within its	 permissible
limits.	  From	the  statement of objects  and	reasons,  it
appears	 that in the principal Act, the	 legislative  intent
was  not clearly brought out.  By means of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_18">Amending	 Act</a>
the legislature wanted to make clear its intent. [510 D]
(iv) In	 a  democratic set up it is for the  legislature  to
decide	what economic or social policy it should  pursue  or
what administrative considerations it should bear in  mind.,
The classification between the processed or split pulses and
unprocessed    or   unsplit   pulses   is    a	  reasonable
classification.	 It is based on the use to which those goods
can  be	 put.  Hence, the impugned  classification  was	 not
violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution. [511 <a href="/doc/1048632/" id="a_20">F]
Khandige  Sham	and  ors. v.  The  Agricultural	 Income	 Tax
Officer</a>, [1963] 3 S.C.R. 809 referred to.
(v)  The levy was not violative of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_21">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a> and	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_22">(g).</a>
amendment  of  the  Act	 was  necessitated  because  of	 the
legislature's failure bring out clearly in the principal Act
its intenion to separate the processed or split pulses	from
the   unsplit	or   unprocessed   pulses.    Further	 the
retrospective  amendment became necessary as  otherwise	 the
State  would  have  to	refund large  sums  of	money.	 The
contention  that the retrospective levy did Dot	 afford	 any
opportunity to the dealers to pass on the tax payable to the
consumers, has not much validity.  The tax is levied on	 the
dealers,  the fact that he is allowed to pass on the tax  to
the  consumers or he is generally in a position to  pass  on
the  same to the consumer has no relevance when	 legislative
competence is under consideration. [511 G]
(vi) Ordinarily	 a proviso to a section is intended to	take
out a part of the main section for special treatment.  It is
not  expected to enlarge the main section.  But	 cases	have
arisen	in which this Court has held that despite  the	fact
that a provision is called proviso, 'it is really a separate
provision  and	the  so	 called	 proviso  has  substantially
altered	 the  main  section.  If on a  true  reading  of  an
Explanation it appears that it has widened the scope of	 the
main section, effect must be given to the legislative intent
not  withstanding the fact that the legislature	 named	that
provision as an Explanation. [512 C]

Commissioner of	 Income.,tax,  Bombay  City.   <a href="/doc/1359356/" id="a_23">Bombay	v.
Bininchandra  Maganlal &amp; Co. Ltd.  Bombay</a>. [1961]  2  S.C.R.

and  Bihta Cooperative Development Cane Marketing  UnionLtd.
and  anr.  v. Bank of Bihar and ors., [1967]  1	 S.C.R.	 848
referred to.
The  contention thatExplanation 11 to s. 3 D did not  widen
the scope of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_25"> s. 3-D</a> could notbe accepted. <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_26">Section 3-D</a> as  it
originally stood dealt with foodgrainsand pulses. It did not
treat the unprocessed or unsplit foodgrains and pulses as  a
separate  item.	 The newly added Explanation brings  to	 tax
with retrospective effect the split or processed  foodgrains
as well. [513E]
(vii) It cannot be said that because the notification  under
s.  3D	continues to refer to foodgrains only,	it  was	 not
possible  to  tax processed or split  foodgrains  under	 it.
Section	 3 D  refers  to  foodgrains,  but  be..cause	of
Explanaticon II, the expression "foodgrains" has to be	read
as  containing	two  different	items  processed  or   split
foodgrains   and   upprocessed	 or   unsplit	 foodgrains.
Consequtntly  while reading the expression  "foodgrains"  in
the  notification  also the same approach must	be  adopted.
This  conclusion  is also obvious from<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_27"> s. 7</a>  which  says  in
plain  words  that the notification must be deemed  to	have
been issued under<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_28"> s. 3-D</a> as amended.  While a taxing statute
must  be strictly construed, but that ,does not mean that  a
provision in a taxing statute should not be read reasonably.
[514 H]
(viii)	  <a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_29">Section  3</a>  -D does not suffer from  the  vice  of
delegation of legislative power to the executive.
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_30">In  the Act</a> under<a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_31"> s. 3</a> the legislature has sought to  impose
multi-point  tax on all 'sales and purchase.   After  having
done  that  it	has given power to  the	 executive,  a	high
authority  and	which is presumed to  command  the  majority
support in the legislative, to select for special  treatment
dealings  in certain class of goods.  In the very nature  of
things,	 it is impossible for the legislature  to  enumerate
goods, dealings in which sales tax or purchase tax should be
imposed. it is also impossible for the legislature to select
the goods which should be subjected to a single point  sales
or  purchase  tax.  Before making  such	 selections  several
aspects	 such  as  the impact of the levy  on  the  society,
economic  consequences	and the	 administrative	 convenience
will have to he considered.  These factors may change  from
time  to  time.	 Hence in the very nature of  things,  these
details have got to be left to the executive. [515 B]

Hegde,	J.  These  are appeals by  certificate.	 They  raise
common questions of law for decision, and they are  directed
against a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court.
The  facts  of the case lie within a  narrow  compass.	 The
appellants  are dealers in foodgrains including cereals	 and
pulses	especially  split or processed foodgrains  and	dal.
The dispute in this case centers round the question  whether
the  Government	 is  competent	to  levy  sales-tax  on	 the
purchases   made  by  the  appellants  of  split   processed
foodgrains  and	 dal  under the	 provisions  of	 the  United
Provinces  Sales  Tax  Act, 1948 as  amended  by  the  Uttar
Pradesh	 Sales Tax Act (Amendment and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_32">Validation) Act</a>,	1970
(which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act).
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_33">Under  the Sales Tax Act</a> as it originally stood	 which	will
</p><p id="p_8">-hereinafter  be  referred  to as the  principal  Act),	 the

dealers	 were sought, to be brought to tax under<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_34"> s.  3-D</a>  of
the  principal Act read with the notification  issued.	 The
validity  of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand  Prasan
Kumar,	the appellant in Civil Appeal NO'. 1625 of  1971  in
respect	 of  the assessment made on him for  the  assessment
year  1966-67  by assessment order dated June  30,  1968  by
means of a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution.
The  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding
that the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not
be  said  to be a commodity essentially different  from	 the
arhar  dal  purchased by the dal mills and  accordingly	 the
purchases effected by the petitioner could not be  regarded
as  the first purchases.  This decision is reported  in	 25,
S.T.C.	p. 118.	 Thereafter the Governor of U.P.  issued  an
ordinance  known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax  (Amendment	 and
Validation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance

	      "Sections	 3-A and 3-D of the U.P.  Sales	 Tax
	      Act,  1948 provide for single point  taxation.
	      Under the fondler section the tax is levied on
	      the turnover of sales, while under the  latter
	      the  tax	is levied on the turnover  of  first
	      purchases.  Plain and ornamented glass bangles

	      separately  subject to tax under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_54">section	3-D</a>.
	      It has been held by the High Court in one case

	      and ornamented glass bangles under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_55">section 3-A</a>

	      two  different commodities.   These  judgments

</blockquote><p id="p_16">The  source  of	 the  legislative power	 to  levy  sales  or
purchase  tax  on goods is Entry 54 of the List	 II  of	 the
Constitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to
constitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a
power to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.
In this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes
within	itself	the power to  tax  retrospectively--see	 <a href="/doc/565623/" id="a_70">The
Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra</a>;(1) <a href="/doc/1291316/" id="a_71">M. P.  Sundararamier

In the last mentioned case it was specifically decided	that
where  the legislature can make a valid law, it can  provide
not  only  for	the prospective operation  of  the  material
provisions  of the said law but it can also provide for	 the
retrospective operation of the said provisions.
We see no force in the second contention advanced on  behalf
of  the	 appellants.  As seen earlier the  general  rule  as
enunciated in<a href="/doc/230008/" id="a_75"> s. 3</a> is multi point tax sales tax or  purchase

<p id="p_21">is conferred on the Government to select any transaction  in
respect	 of such goods or class of goods as  the  Government
may choose to levy a single point sales tax or purchase tax.
It  is open to the legislature to define the nature  of	 the
goods,	the sale or purchase of which should be	 brought  to
tax.   Legislature  was	 not  incompetent  to  separate	 the
processed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed
pulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.
<a href="/doc/436116/" id="a_76">In  Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India</a>,(1) question  arose
for  decision  whether	it was open to	the  legislature  to
impose	separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well  as  on
broken leaf of tobacco.	 This Court overruled the contention
that  such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open	 for
the legislature to separate the two items.  We see no  basis
for  the  contention  that the legislature  cannot  for	 the
purpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed
Pulses	from the unsplit or unprocessed.  The power  of	 the
legislature  to specify the nature of the goods the sale  or
purchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide.
Now coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the
contention  that  the legislature has usurped  any  judicial
power.	The legislature has not purported either directly or
by  necessary implication to overrule the decisions  of	 the
Allahabad  High.  Court in Tilok Chand Prasan  Kumar's	case
(supra).   On the other hand it. has accepted that  decision
as  correct;  but  has sought to remove the  basis  of	that
decision  by retrospectively changing the law.	 This  Court
has pointed out in several cases the distinction between the
encroachment on the judicial power and the nullification  of
the  effect  of	 a judicial decision  by  changing  the	 law
retrospectively.   The former is outside the  competence  of
the  legislature but, the latter is within  its	 permissible
limits.	  From	the  statement of objects  and	reasons,  it
appears	 that in the principal Act, the	 legislative  intent
was  not clearly brought out.  By means of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_77">Amending	 Act</a>
the legislature wanted to make clear its intent.
The fourth contention also appears to be without any  basis.
It  is	true that the taxing statutes are  not	outside	 the
scope  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_78">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution.	But the	 legislature
has  wide  powers of classification in the  case  of  taxing
statutes.
</p><p id="p_22">In Jagannath's case (supra), this Court ruled that there was
no unconstitutional discrimination in the imposition of	 the
excise duty on tobacco in the broken leaf form.	 Therein  it
was  observed  that  tobacco in the, broken  leaf  form	 was
capable	 of  being used in the manufacture  of	bidis  while
tobacco	 in  the  whole	 leaf form  could  not	be  so	used
economically; the two forms of tobacco were different by the
test  of capability of user; the tariff is not based  either
wholly or even primarily by reference to the
(1)  [1962] 2 S.C.R. 118.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">511</span>
<p id="p_23">use  of	 tobacco  and  there was  a  clear  and	 unambiguous
distinction between tobacco  the whole leaf form covered  by
item 5 and tobacco in the broken leaf form covered by item 6
which  had a reasonable relation to the object	intended  by
the imposition of the tariff.
</p><p id="p_24"><a href="/doc/1048632/" id="a_79">In  Khandige Sham Bhat and Ors. v. The	Agricultural  Income
Tax  Officer</a>,(1) this Court laid down the tests to find	 out
whether	 there	are discriminatory provisions  in  a  taxing
statute.  Therein this Court observed that in order to judge
whether	 a law was discriminatory what had primarily  to  be
looked into was not its phraseology but its real effect.  If
there was equality and uniformity within each group, the law
could  :pot  be	 discriminatory, though	 due  to  fortuitous
circumstances  in  a peculiar situation some included  in  a
class might get some advantage over others, so long as	they
were  not  sought  out	for  special  treatment.    Although
taxation laws could be no exception to this rule, the courts
would,	in  view  of  the  inherent  complexity	 of   fiscal
adjustment  of diverse elements, permit a larger  discretion
to  the legislature in the matter of classification so	long
as there was no transgression of the fundamental  principles
underlying the doctrine of classification.  The power of the
legislature  to	 classify  must	 necessarily  be  wide	 and
flexible so as to enable it to adjust its system of taxation
in all proper and reasonable ways.
</p><p id="p_25">It  must  be  noticed that generally  speaking	the  primary
purpose of the levy of all taxes is to raise funds for	pub-
lie  good.  Which person should be taxed,  what	 transaction
should be taxed or what goods should be taxed, depends	upon
social,	 economic and administrative considerations.   In  a
democratic  set up it is for the legislature to decide	what
economic   or  social  policy  it  should  pursue  or	what
administrative	consideration it should bear in	 mind.	 The
classification between the processed or split pulses and un-
processed or unsplit pulses is a reasonable  classification.
It  is	based on the use to which those goods can,  be	put.
Hence,	in our opinion, the impugned classification  is	 not
violative of.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_80">Art. 14.</a>
</p><p id="p_26">A  feeble attempt was made to' show that  the  retrospective
levy made under the Act is violative of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_81">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a>	 and
</p><p id="p_27">(g)  But  we see no substance in that contention.   As	seen
earlier,  the amendment of the Act was necessitated  because
of  the	 legislatures failure to bring out  clearly  in	 the
principal  Act	its intention to separate the  processed  or
split  pulses  from  the,  unsplit  or	unprocessed  pulses.
Further	 the  retrospective amendment  became  necessary  as
otherwise the State would have to refund large sum of money.
The  contention that the retrospective levy did	 not  afford
any opportunity to the dealers to pass on the tax payable to
the consumers, has not much validity.  The tax is levied  on
the dealer;

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">512</span>
<p id="p_29">the  fact  that	 he is allowed to pass on  the	tax  to	 the
consumers or he is generally in position to pass on the same
to  the	 consumer   has no relevance when  we  consider	 the
legislative competence.
</p><p id="p_30">It was next urged that on a true contribution of Explanation
II to<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_82"> s. 3-D</a>, no charge can be said to have been created  on
the purchases of split or processed pulses.  It was  firstly
contended that an Explanation cannot extend the scope of the
main  section;	it  can	 only  explain	that  section.	  In
construing a statutory provision, the first and the foremost
rule of construction is the literary construction.  All that
we  have  to  see  at the very	outset	is  what  does	that
provision say ? If the provision is unambiguous and if	from
that provision, the legislative intent is clear, we need not
call  into aid the other rules of construction of  statutes.
The other rules of construction of statutes are called	into
aid  only  when	 the legislative  intention  is	 not  clear.
Ordinarily a proviso to a section is intended to take out  a
part  of the main section for special treatment.  It is	 not
expected  to  enlarge the scope of the main  section-.	 But
cases have arisen in which this Court has held that  despite
the fact that a provision is called proviso, it is really  a
separate   provision   and   the   socalled   proviso	 has
substantially altered' the main section. In Commissioner  of
Income-tax, Bombay, City. <a href="/doc/1359356/" id="a_83">Bombay v. Bipinchandra Maganlal  &amp;
Co. Ltd., Bombay</a>,(1) this Court held that by the fiction  in
S.  10(2)(vii)	second proviso read with<a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_84"> S. 2</a>  (6C)  of	 the
Indian	Income-tax Act, 1922 what is really not	 income	 is,
for  the purpose of computation of assessable income,  made,
taxable income.
</p><p id="p_31">	      <a href="/doc/1669028/" id="a_85">In State of Rajasthan v. Leela Jain</a>   2	this
	      Court observed
	      "The primary purpose of the proviso now  under
	      consideration is, it is apparent, to provide a
	      substitute  or an alternative remedy  to	that
	      which  is	 prohibited by the main part  of <a href="/doc/101389/" id="a_86"> S.
	      4(1)</a>.  There is, therefore, no question of the
	      proviso  carving	out any portion out  of	 the
	      area covered by the main part and leaving	 the
	      other  part unaffected.  What we	have  stated
	      earlier  should suffice to establish that	 the
	      proviso- now before us is really not a proviso
	      in  the  accepted	 sense	but  an	 independent
	      legislative  provision  by which to  a  remedy
	      which  is prohibited by the main part  of	 the
	      section,	an alternative is provided..  It  is
	      further obvious to us that the proviso is	 not
	      coextensive with but covers a field wider than
	      the main part of<a href="/doc/101389/" id="a_87"> S. 4</a> (1 ) ".

	      Therein this Court observed:
</p><p id="p_35">	      "The  question then arises whether  the  first
	      Explanation to the section widens the scope of
	      sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_91"> s. 48</a> so as to include claims by
	      registered societies against non-members	even
	      if the same are not covered by clause (c)."
On  the basis of the language of the Explanation this  Court
held  that  it did not widen the scope of clause  (c).	 But
from what has been said in the case, it is clear that if  on
a  true	 reading of an Explanation it appears  that  it	 has
widened the scope of the main section, effect must be  given
to the legislative intent notwithstanding the fact that	 the
legislature named that provision as an Explanation.  In	 all
these matters the courts have to find out the true intention
of the legislature.
</p><p id="p_36">We  are unable to accept the contention that Explanation  II
to<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_92"> s. 3-D</a> did not widen. the scope of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_93"> s. 3-D</a>.  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_94">Section 3-D</a> s
it  originally stood dealt with foodgrains and	pulses.	  It
did  not  treat the unprocessed or  unsplit  foodgrains	 and
pulses as a separate item but because of Explanation 11,  we
have  now to read the expression "foodgrains" in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_95"> s.  3-D</a>  as
containing   two   separate  items   viz.   (1)	  foodgrains
unprocessed  or	 unsplit  and (2)  foodgrains  processed  or
split.	 It is true that Explanation 11 is not very  happily
worded	but  the intention of the legislature is  clear	 and
unambiguous.  The newly added Explanation brings to tax with
retrospective  effect the split or processed  foodgrains  as
well.
</p><p id="p_37">We next come to the contention that no levy of purchase	 tax
can  be made on split or unprocessed pulses without a  fresh
notification  under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_96"> S. 3-D</a> read with Explanation 11  showing
therein separately foodgrains unsplit or unprocessed as well
as foodgrains split or processed.  As seen earlier that	 the
notification  issued  merely  refers  to  foodgrains.	That
notification does not classify foodgrains into two  separate
categories-processed  or split and unprocessed	or  unsplit.
Therefore  we  were  told  that no  tax	 can  be  levied  on
processed   or	split  foodgrains  on  the  basis  of	that
notification.	 This  contention  cannot  be  accepted	  as
correct.   The notification in question was issued under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_97"> S.
3-D</a>,  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_98">Section  3-D</a>  refers to  foodgrains;  but	 because  of
Explanation  11	 to that section, we have now  to  read	 the
expression  "foodgrains" as containing two different  items,
processed  or  split foodgrains and unprocessed	 or  unsplit
foodgrains.   Consequently  while  reading  the	  expression
"foodgrains"  in  the notification also, we must  adopt	 the
same  approach.	 This conclusion is also obvious from<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_99"> S.  7</a>.
If  the	 legislature had not retrospectively  validated	 the
assessments  made  on  the  first  purchases  of  split	  or
processed  foodgrain. what did<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_100"> s. 7</a> seek to achieve  ?	That
section says in plain words that not-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">514</span>
<p id="p_38">withstanding  any judgment, decree or order of any court  or
tribunal  to  the  contrary, every  notification  issued  or
purporting to have been issued under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_101"> s. 3-D</a> of the principal
Act.  before the commencement of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_102">Amending Act</a>  shall  be
deemed to have been issued under that section as amended  by
the  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_103">Amending Act</a> and shall be so interpreted and be  deemed
to be and always to. have been as valid as if the provisions
of the amending Act were in force at all material times	 and
accordingly,  anything done or any action  taken  (including
any  order made, proceedings taken, jurisdiction  exercised,
assessment   made,  or	tax  levied,  collected	  or   paid,
purporting  to have, been done or taken in pursuance of	 any
such notification) shall be deemed to be, and always to have
been validly and lawfully done or taken.
We  asked the learned Counsel appearing for the	 appellant's
to  let	 us  know the field in which<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_104"> S. 7</a>  can	be  said  to
operate.   Their  answer  was that  though  the	 legislature
intended  to  validate	the assessments made  on  the  first
purchases  of  the  split or processed	dal,  it  failed  to
achieve	 that  object because of the  defective	 phraseology
employed  in  Explanation  11  to<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_105"> s. 3-D</a> and <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_106"> S.  7</a>  of	 the
Amending Act.  In other words their submission was that<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_107"> S. 7</a>
has  become otios.  It was urged on behalf of the appellants
that a taxing provision	 will	 have	to    be    strictly
interpreted  and  in  finding  out  the	 intention  of	 the
legislature in the matter of imposing tax, we cannot  travel
beyond the words of the section.
</p><p id="p_39">There is no doubt that a taxing provision has to be strictly
interpreted.  If any legislature intends to impose any	tax,
that  intention must be made clear by the language  employed
in the statute; but that does not mean that the provision in
a  taxing  statute  should  not	 be  read  reasonably.	 The
contention that we should ignore<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_108"> S. 7</a> of the Amending Act is
a  contention  difficult  of  acceptance.   Dealing  with  a
similar	 contention  Venkatarama Ayyar J. speaking  for	 the
Court in J. K. Jute Mills' case (supra) observed at p. 435
	      "The  object of the legislation as  stated  in
	      the long title and in the preamble to the	 Act
	      was  to validate the impugned notification  in
	      relation	to the amended section.	 Schedule  B
	      to  the Act expressly mentions that  notifica-
	      tion.   And  if we are now to accede  to	the,
	      contention  of' the petitioner, we  must	hold
	      that though the legislature set about avowedly
	      to  validate the notification dated March	 31,
	      1956,  it	 failed to achieve that	 object.   A
	      construction which will lead to such a  result
	      must, if that is possible, be avoided."
</p><p id="p_40">We  have  earlier  come	 to  the  conclusion  that   because
Explanation  II	 to <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_109"> S.	 3-D</a>  the,  expression	 "foodgrains
including pulses" in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_110"> s.	 3-D</a> should be read as including two
different items i.e., (1)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">515</span>
unsplit	 or unprocessed foodgrains including pulses and	 (2)
split	 or   processed	  foodgrains	including    pulses.
Consequently the expression "foodgrains" in the notification
will also have to be read in the same manner.  This, in	 our
opinion, is the reasonable way of reading the notification
in  the light of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_111"> s. 3-D</a>, Explanation 11 to that section	 and
s. 7 of the Act.
</p><p id="p_41">The only remaining contention is that the delegation made to
the  executive under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_112"> s. 3-D</a> is an excessive delegation.	  It
is true that the legislature cannot delegate its legislative
functions  to  any  other  body-.   But	 subject  to,	that
qualification,	it  is permissible for	the  legislature  to
delegate the power to select the persons on whom the tax  is
to  be levied or the goods or the transactions on which	 the
tax  is	 to  be	 lievied.   <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_113">In	the  Act</a>,  under <a href="/doc/230008/" id="a_114"> s.  3</a>	 the
legislature  has  sought to impose multi-point	tax  on	 all
sales  and purchases.  After having done that it  has  given
power  to  the	executive, a high  authority  and  which  is
presumed to command the majority support in the legislature,
to select for special treatment dealings in certain class of
goods.	 In the very nature of things, it is impossible	 for
the legislature to enumerate goods, dealings in which  sales
tax  or	 purchase,  tax	 should	 be  imposed.	It  is	also
impossible  for	 the legislature to select the	goods  which
should be subjected to a single point sales or purchase tax.
Before	making such selections several aspects such  as	 the
impact of the levy on the society, economic consequences and
the  administrative convenience will have to be	 considered.
These  factors may change from time to time.  Hence  in	 the
very nature of things, these details have got to be left  to
the executive.
</p><p id="p_42"><a href="/doc/797174/" id="a_115">In  Pt.	 Banarsi Das Bhanot and Ors. v. The State of  Madhya
Pradesh	 and  Ors</a>.  (1) the question arose  whether  it	 was
permissible for the legislature to empower the executive  to
amend  the Schedule relating to exemptions.  This  Court  by
majority  answered  that question in  the  affirmative.	  It
further	 held  that  it	 is  not  unconstitutional  for	 the
legislature  to leave it to the executive to  determine	 the
details	 relating to the working of the taxation laws,	such
as  the	 selection of the persons on whom the tax is  to  be
levied, the rates at which it is to be charged in respect of
different classes of goods and the like.
We  have not found any substance in any of  the	 contentions
advanced  on behalf of the appellants.	Hence these  appeals
fail and they are dismissed with costs--hearing fee one set.
